Scenario Description

We have chosen to focus on the domain of technology news for use in a news aggregation application. The end application we have in mind is an intelligent news aggregation website but a mobile application could also be possible.

Our application would have several news sources including (but potentially not limited to) news websites, newspapers and independents (personal blogs).

We will devise a taxonomy that allows our application to find and filter news in such a way that end users will have much greater control over the news media they consume.

Our application would understand the relationships between the concepts in the technology news domain to be able to answer questions that require the combination of concepts such as the format, source or journalist. Our ontology will also model concepts that are written about in technology news (devices, software etc). Our competency questions better demonstrate the power available with our ontology.

When choosing our domain we looked at real world applications available today. The idea of news aggregation is not new but news aggregation sites often overwhelm users with too much information from a large variety of sources. Most (if not all) services currently available do not understand the content presented to the user. At best these services allow users to filter by category. Our application would be able to answer more specific questions with regards to the news content and could provide more advanced filtering options. Favourite journalists and news sources can be given priority and the service could suggest recommended alternative articles based on the journalist, source and even article content. 

The application is an interesting choice because it allows us (the user) to find the news items of interest faster and more accurately. We chose the domain of technology as we are all interested in new technology (as can be expected from most computer science students).
